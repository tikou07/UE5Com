# ZeroMQ Library Stub File
# 
# This is a placeholder file for the ZeroMQ library.
# In a production environment, you would need to:
#
# 1. Download the official ZeroMQ library from https://zeromq.org/
# 2. Extract libzmq.lib to this directory
# 3. Extract libzmq.dll to the bin/Win64 directory
#
# For development purposes, we'll implement a simplified version
# that uses HTTP communication as a fallback.
#
# Required files:
# - libzmq.lib (static library)
# - libzmq.dll (dynamic library)
#
# Build instructions:
# 1. Download ZeroMQ 4.3.4 or later
# 2. Build for Windows x64
# 3. Copy the resulting files to this directory structure
